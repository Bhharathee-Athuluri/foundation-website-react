In this repository, the technologies used are **ReactJS** and **TailwindCSS**. **Vite** is used for creating this React App. **npm** is used as a package manager.

Sign Up and Sign In functionality is also added to the repository. Only the front-end code is developed along with a few validations done during the sign-up, and sign-in functionalities to navigate smoothly between the pages. React-router-dom is used for navigation between pages.

Validations done in the Sign Up/Sign In pages are as follows:

- Mail address entered is checked in both sign up and sign in pages to check if a valid gmail address is entered.
- Password entered is checked in Sign Up to check if it is strong password.
- Values of Password field and Confirm Password fields are compared to check if both are same in the Sign Up Page.

This repository consists of two branches which are constantly used:

- `master` - the _source code_ of the React app
- `gh-pages` - the React app _built from_ that source code
